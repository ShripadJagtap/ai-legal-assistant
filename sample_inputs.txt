A man broke into my house at night while my family was sleeping. He stole jewelry and cash from our bedroom. When I confronted him, he threatened me with a knife and ran away. We reported it to the police, but I'm not sure which legal charges should be filed under IPC.

My neighbor constantly plays loud music past midnight, even after several requests to stop. What legal action can I take according to the IPC?

Someone sent me threatening messages demanding money. Is this covered under the IPC, and what section would apply?
